## Utility Company - Data-Driven Decision Making

UtilityCo is a leading utility company that provides electricity, gas, and water services to millions of customers. They generate a vast amount of data from various sources, including smart meters, IoT devices, customer interactions, maintenance logs, and weather sensors. UtilityCo recognizes the potential value of this data for making informed decisions, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing customer satisfaction. However, they are encountering several challenges in effectively utilizing their data.

### Data Sources:

- **Smart Meters:** UtilityCo collects data from millions of smart meters installed at customer locations. This data includes energy consumption, demand patterns, and power quality information.
- **IoT Devices:** They deploy IoT devices to monitor infrastructure health, such as transformers, substations, and distribution lines. These devices provide real-time data on voltage, current, temperature, and equipment status.
- **Customer Interactions:** UtilityCo captures data from various customer touchpoints, such as call center interactions, online portals, and mobile applications. This data includes customer complaints, service requests, and feedback.
- **Maintenance Logs:** They maintain logs of equipment maintenance activities, including repair schedules, spare parts usage, and maintenance costs. These logs contain valuable information about asset performance and reliability.
- **Weather Sensors:** UtilityCo utilizes weather sensors to monitor weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. This data helps in predicting energy demand and planning for weather-related challenges.

### Challenges and Problems:
- **Data Silos:** UtilityCo's data is scattered across multiple systems and departments, leading to data silos. Integrating and analyzing data from different sources becomes challenging, hindering holistic decision-making.
- **Data Quality and Consistency:** The utility company faces issues related to data quality, such as missing or inaccurate data points. Inconsistent data formats and standards across systems make data integration and analysis complex.
- **Real-time Analytics:** UtilityCo struggles to process and analyze streaming data from smart meters and IoT devices in real-time. They face challenges in monitoring energy consumption, detecting anomalies, and responding promptly to operational issues.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** The company lacks a systematic approach to identify potential equipment failures and schedule proactive maintenance. This leads to unexpected downtime, increased maintenance costs, and customer dissatisfaction.
- **Customer Segmentation:** UtilityCo wants to segment their customer base to better understand their needs, preferences, and usage patterns. However, the manual and time-consuming process limits their ability to deliver personalized services and targeted communication.
